2. **Budget Overruns**: Unexpected costs may exceed the allocated budget.
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor expenses closely and maintain a contingency fund for unexpected expenses.

3. **Compliance Violations**: Risk of non-compliance with building codes and safety regulations.
   - **Mitigation**: Regularly consult with compliance experts and ensure all permits are obtained before starting work.
